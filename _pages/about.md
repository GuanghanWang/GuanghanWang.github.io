I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Cornell Tech in NYC, where I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Volodymyr Kuleshov](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kuleshov/). My research interests center around **probabilistic generative models** and their applications in scientific domains. Lately, I have developed a strong interest in **diffusion language models**.


Before coming to Cornell, I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University with honor (2020-2024). In 2023, I spent a wonderful summer at CMU collaborating with [Prof. Jian Ma](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jianma/).


If you'd like to collaborate or discuss research, feel free to reach out at gw354@cornell.edu!
